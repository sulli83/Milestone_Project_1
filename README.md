### HTML5
HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. 
It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.

### CSS3-
is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. 
It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions
or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts


 
### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
